"Penguins are a group of flightless, semi-aquatic, sea birds which live almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere. Only one species, the Galápagos penguin, lives at, and slightly north of, the equator. Highly adapted for life in the ocean water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other forms of sea life which they catch with their bills and swallow whole while swimming. A penguin has a spiny tongue and powerful jaws to grip slippery prey.",human,wikipedia
